About
-----

Jaziku is a software for the implementation of composite analysis
metodology between the major indices of climate variability and major
meteorological variables in puntual scale.

According to IDEAM’s commitment to promote and guide scientiﬁc research
about weather forecast and climate, "Jazikü" is a program designed to
evaluate teleconnections between meteorological variables with the main
indices of climate variability aﬀecting climate in Colombia.

Jaziku, follows the composite methodology analysis proposed by The
University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)), National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) & U.S. Department of Commerce
(DOC) [1]_ [2]_ [3]_ and can produce probability scenarios
under which it is expected precipitation or any other variable for speciﬁc
sites or areas interpolated to behave, as a function of the probability
values predicted for each climate variability and the history of
involvement in the quarterly average level. Such scenarios become a
powerful tool for decision making by the national meteorological services

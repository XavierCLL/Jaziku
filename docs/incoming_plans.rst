Incoming Plans / TODO
=====================

0.7 (**2013-xx-xx**)
--------------------
- Add month and two-months to analysis resolution
- Include MEI index for bimonthly analysis
- Include ARH amazon index

0.8 (**2013-xx-xx**)
--------------------
:Exploratory data analysis consolidation:
- **Correlation:** Autocorrelogram, Cross Correlogram (Var INDP), cross-correlation matrix between all series
- **Outliers:** Diagram 4-band dispersion, series plot with standard fixed threshold vs time
- **Missing values for each variable and Test bias:** List of missing values, time series vs time ( with shade
 for missing values),% pie chart for more missing value repeated, the year with the highest number with missing
 values, filling series with mean and median (entire series), frequency histogram pre and post after fill each series
- Standardized variables graphic option (Dependent variable transformation to the same format of Independent Variable)

0.9 (**2013-xx-xx**)
--------------------
:Homogeneity analysis:
- Stability in mean (Tes-t)
- Stability in median (Test MWW)
- Randomness (Test Runs)
- Changing trend (Fisher test)
- Mass curve for (Q, HR, PPT)
- Migrate/make manual, documentation and main page of Jaziku to sphinx using reStructuredTex http://sphinx-doc.org/

0.10 (**2013-XX-XX**)
--------------------
- Inclusion of spectral analysis

0.11 (**2013-XX-XX**)
--------------------
- Inclusion of wavelete analysis

To be included
--------------
- adjust the PPT var for accumulate the data daily by default
- to able to change the labels for var D
- include the shapes maps for protected regions of Colombia
- save log
- Colombia with San Andres and Providencia
- print console through classes
- auto-validations (skills)

0.6 (**2013-02-xx**)
--------------------
- Calculation of contingency tables for 4 and 5 categories
- Nonparametric Tests of contingency table for 4 and 5 categories
- Risk analysis for contingency tables for 4 and 5 categories
- Calculations of values of the dependent variable intervals
- Recalculate the value index files for maps
- Modification of Figures for 3, 4 and 5 categories
- Modification of maps for 3, 4 and 5 categories
- Modification of the linear combination between the contingency table and forecasted by categories of the independent variable.
- Modification of the option analog years for 4 and 5 categories

0.7 (**2013-04-xx**)
--------------------
- Add month and two-months to analysis resolution
- Include MEI index for bimonthly analysis
- Standardized variables graphic option (Dependent variable transformation to the same format of Independent Variable)
- Migrate/make manual, documentation and main page of Jaziku to sphinx using reStructuredTex http://sphinx-doc.org/

0.8 (**2013-05-xx**)
--------------------
- ROCs auto-validations

0.9 (**2013-xx-xx**)
--------------------
:Exploratory data analysis consolidation:
- **Correlation:** Autocorrelogram, Cross Correlogram (Var INDP), cross-correlation matrix between all series
- **Outliers:** Box Plot, Diagram 4-band dispersion, series plot with standard fixed
 threshold vs time
- **Missing values for each variable and Test bias:** List of missing values, time series vs time ( with shade for missing values),% pie chart for more missing value repeated,
 the year with the highest number with missing values, filling series with mean and median (entire series),
 frequency histogram pre and post after fill each series

0.10 (**2013-xx-xx**)
--------------------
:Homogeneity analysis:
- Stability in mean (Tes-t)
- Stability in median (Test MWW)
- Randomness (Test Runs)
- Changing trend (Fisher test)
- Mass curve for (Q, HR, PPT)

0.11 (**2013-XX-XX**)

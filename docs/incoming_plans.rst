0.5 (**2012-10-05**)
--------------------

- Descriptive statistics: sample size, maximum and minimum, average, standard deviation,
  skewness and kurtosis coefficient of variation, median
- Inspection of the series, linearity and nonlinearity: Graphic Series VarDep and
  VarIndp vs time, Climatology (multiannual monthly average), Climatology (maximum-minimum
  monthly multiyear), Climatology (Multiyear: Decade, fifteen and five days)
- Examination of the distribution: Scatterplots among all series, frequency histogram, Shapiro-Wilks test
- Outliers by atypical station list and depending on the phases of the phenomenon of VarIndp

- Calculation of contingency tables for 4 and 5 categories
- Nonparametric Tests of contingency table for 4 and 5 categories
- Risk analysis for contingency tables for 4 and 5 categories
- Calculations of values of the dependent variable intervals
- Recalculate the value index files for maps
- Modification of Figures for 3, 4 and 5 categories
- Modification of maps for 3, 4 and 5 categories
- Modification of the linear combination between the contingency table and prognosis
  by categories of the independent variable.
- Modification of the option analog years for 4 and 5 categories

0.7 (**2013-xx-xx**)
--------------------

:Exploratory data analysis consolidation:

- **Correlation:** Autocorrelogram, Cross Correlogram (Var INDP), cross-correlation matrix between all series
- **Outliers:** Box Plot, Diagram 4-band dispersion, series plot with standard fixed
  threshold vs time
- **Missing values for each variable and Test bias:** List of missing values, time series vs time ( with shade for missing values),% pie chart for more missing value repeated,
  the year with the highest number with missing values, filling series with mean and median (entire series),
  frequency histogram pre and post after fill each series

0.8 (**2013-xx-xx**)
--------------------

:Homogeneity analysis:

- Stability in mean (Tes-t)
- Stability in median (Test MWW)
- Randomness (Test Runs)
- Changing trend (Fisher test)
- Mass curve for (Q, HR, PPT)

0.9 (**2013-XX-XX**)
--------------------

1.0 (**2013-XX-XX**)
--------------------

- Inclusion of wavelete analysis

To be analyzed
--------------

- partial run, if a station has an error continue with other station, alert in final message
- Add altitude parameter for stations and print in results (maps files)

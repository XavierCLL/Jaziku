Description: 
                Jaziku is a software for the implementation of composite analysis 
                metodology between the major indices of climate variability and major 
                meteorological variables in puntual scale.
                          
                According to IDEAM’s commitment to promote and guide scientiﬁc research 
                about weather forecasting and climate, "Jazikü" is a program designed to 
                evaluate teleconnections between meteorological variables with the main 
                indices of climate variability aﬀecting climate in Colombia.
                
                Jaziku, follows the composite methodology analysis proposed by The 
                University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR)), National Oceanic 
                and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) & U.S. Department of Commerce 
                (DOC)[1][1, 2][1, 2, 3][1, 2, 3] and can produce probability scenarios 
                under which it is expected precipitation or any other variable for speciﬁc 
                sites or areas interpolated to behave, as a function of the probability 
                values predicted for each climate variability and the history of involvement 
                in the quarterly average level. Such scenarios become a powerful tool for 
                decision making by the national meteorological services

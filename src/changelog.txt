0.4.1
features/changes:
 * new option in runfile for select lags to run, this can be 0, 1 and/or 2, 
   combination of these or default (this is all).
 * new option in runfile, now you can use any type for dependent variable and 
   select particular values for limits.
 * limits var D/I in runfile now can be: none (no check), default (internals limits)
   or particular values.
 * new option in runfile for set threshold for dependent variable, this can be:
   default (this is p33 and p66), pNN, sdNN or particular value. 
 * new option for maps in runfile, now you can select what you want to run for
   maps, maps can be 'climate', 'forecasting', 'correlation' combination of these, 
   or 'all' .
bugfixes:
 * fix check and default value for process period in runfile
 * fix console message for graphics process, enable/disable activation

0.4.0
features/changes:
 * get configuration run and station list in the same file, delete all arguments
   when run Jaziku, now only argument is "-runfile" and this files contains all
   the necessary to run Jaziku.
 * adds parameters for maps options in runfile
 * ignore station line in runfile that begin with "#"
 * Now maps files and maps for climate and forecasting are ordered 
   and grouped based on analysis interval
 * Implemented HPGL library for interpolation of the data maps (ordinary kriging
   in this version) and the user can change parameters for interpolation in 
   runfile 
 * Generate maps with NCL based in files output of interpolation 
 * Shapes and grids internal with particular ncl scripts and extreme lat and lon
   definition
 * Personal shape
 * Maps for correlations
 * Climate/forecasting and correlation palette colors bar for NCL
 * Posibility for run many countries or regions and group based on their names
 * Posibility to delete data outside of shape, the shape mask method consist 
   in delete all data outside boundaries of shape analyzing all points in mesh
 
bugfixes:
 * many fixies and comprobations of all features and changes
 * (especifig bug that affect 0.3 version) bug translation in phenomenon label


0.3.0
features/changes:
 * now you can run using internal files for independents variables, defining as 
   "default" in "file_I" section inside stations list file.
 * enable run with particular independent variable file
 * change period defined in argument as process period instead of common period,
   ATTENTION! this affects titles, namefiles and captions of all results
 * Result table csv file now write by lags
 * Deleted contingency table in results
 * Changed the resolution of analysis of trimesters to months and even days, now 
   Jaziku can read var D and I with data daily and can print results for 5, 10, 
   and 15 days, with these changes all result (graphics, tables, ...) are different
   depended if data as daily and how to print result (5,10,15 days) 
 * Now maps files (and maps, in the next release) for climate are ordered and 
   grouped based on analysis interval
 * Added 3 new variables independent (SSTA_CAR and AREA_WHWP) and one variable 
   dependent (RUNOFF)
 * Updated transform_data_stations script
 * Consistent data analysis for independent and dependent variable, 
   check the number of null values from all values inside the process period, 
   continue only if it have less than 15%
 * add two new arguments: --disable-consistent-data and --disable-graphics
 * set to default acuracy to 5 decimal point for print result

bugfixes:
 * bugfix the size data when set particular common period
 * fix TYPOS
 * fix when Jaziku detect language from system 
 * fix crash and memory overflow when open many file
 * check different cases to run data daily/monthly and analisis interval defined
 * fixed range interval for var I and different lags when data is daily and 
   result is in 5, 10 or 15 days
 * fixed constant value for var I when run case 2 (var_D daily and var_I monthly)
   for 5, 10 and 15 days 
 * fixed calculating pearson for data daily
 * fixed table order for calculate forecasting
 

0.2.1
 * change name function and filename results of Arithmetic Mean Trim to mean_trim


0.2.0
features/changes:
 * change numeration version
 * applied some PEP8 rules, fix typos and reorganize code
 * aplied color text in console information for errors, warnings and process 
 * final message with number of stations processed when Jaziku has finished
 * new argument input "-l" language selector, e.g. "-l es" 
 * show in terminal the run configuration
 * changes filename outputs for the results and some text inside files/graphics

bugfixes:
 * fix "Segmentation fault" in plt.close() using pyplot
 * show and info error when found wrong line or garbage character in input files
 * fix crash when the name or number from files (station list and files 
   variables input) contain spaces or tabs at the start or/and final of this.
 * fix memory leak using pyplot library    
 * fix several strings messages, correct to translate after install, translation
   works now.

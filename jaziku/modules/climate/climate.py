    In climate process, it calculate the relationship between the dependent and independent
    variable which is generally determined by the joint probability distribution, but that being
    unknown is replaced by the contingency table. To calculate the contingency table the data
    set of the dependent and independent variable is divided into three categories and are found
    the empirical probabilities from the empirical frequency division and the total number of
    pairs that are obtained. Also is calculated the linear correlation, the statistical chi square and
    Cramer's V and in order that the forecasts thrown by the program are reliable, a
    hygrometric distribution is used to describe the probability distribution among all the
    possible categories of the independent variable.
